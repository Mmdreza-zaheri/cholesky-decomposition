# cholesky-decomposition
This project is Cholesky decomposition and solving the system of equations by Cholesky decomposition

# How it works ?
1. First, the program asks you to specify the number of rows and columns of the matrix
2. Enter the dimensions of A matrix . Your matrix must be a positive definite matrix
3. Enter the elements of b matrix .
4. In the last window, the solutions of Linear Equations System and matrix r are displayed
